"""
Here we write a numpy array or arrays to disk formatted as MATLAB
.mat files, and then use the subprocess module to run matlab code on the file
and save it. Then we read the new mat-file back into python.

NOTE: becauae subprocess spawns a completely independent job you can start
as many jobs as you like simlutaneously - or at least as many as you have cores
available. To do this you should omit the stdout and stderr arguments
passed to subprocess.run() because for some reason they make the calling
program wait until the previous subprocess is done.

NOTE: you can run other python programs this way, or really any program.  It
is not limited to MATLAB.

NOTE: to get this to run you will HAVE to edit the line:
cmd = '/Applications/MATLAB_R2017a.app/bin/matlab'
to reflect where MATLAB is on your machine.  On fjord it would be:
cmd = '/usr/local/bin/matlab'
